                and raised in Vancouver, Johnny was the first-born child of Ayako 
                and Shu.&nbsp; The Oshika family greatly valued an active life, 
                so it was - and still is - common to find them camping in remote 
                areas, hiking the many peaks of BC, or skiing in Whistler.&nbsp; 
                This emphasis on outdoor activity formed a lifelong love for sports 
                that Johnny still embraces today.&nbsp; From soccer to hockey 
                in his youth to mountain biking and trail running nowadays, Johnny 
                finds himself just as comfortable sweating at high elevation as 
                he does relaxing at home.</font></p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font color="#400080" face="Papyrus">Education 
                was another key aspect of life that Johnny's parents highly valued.&nbsp; 
                This must have caused a lot of frustration when Johnny's early 
                schooling years showed that he had little interest in education.&nbsp; 
                Johnny's grades were lackluster at best, and often on the verge 
                of failing.&nbsp; Plagued with problems in and out of school, 
                it wasn't until he became best friends with Allen (Best Man) in 
                high school that he realized it was both possible and worth the 
                effort to achieve in school.&nbsp;</font></p></td>

                This was undoubtedly the turning point in Johnny's life.&nbsp; 
                His grades started to flourish and he was able to follow Vince 
                (MC) to study engineering at UBC. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#400080" face="Papyrus">UBC 
          offered many of the usual experiences of university life, but the real 
          education that Johnny got was the experience outside of its classrooms 
          and long-night study sessions.&nbsp; Living away from home, he started 
          feeling a real sense of responsibility that he never had before.&nbsp; 
          The engineering co-op program sent him to live on the other side of 
          the country and even in Europe, where he developed a taste for travel.&nbsp; 
          Most importantly, he spent a couple of work terms at Creo, the company 
          that is now his full-time employer.&nbsp; &nbsp; His experiences at 
          UBC shaped Johnny's early adulthood and helped to define the person 
          that he is today.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#400080" face="Papyrus">Every 
          step along the way, Johnny met people that changed his life.&nbsp; But 
          nothing could have prepared him for what happened in the fall of 2001, 
          when he met Angie.&nbsp; Angie combines good looks, great wit, lifelong 
          curiosity, and a wealth of knowledge that help make Johnny a better 
          person with more focus and direction.&nbsp; She and Johnny are learning 
          together to live life to its greatest potential, and both see this as 
          the beginning of a lifelong partnership.&nbsp; </font></p>
