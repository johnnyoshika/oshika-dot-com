                <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font color="#400080" face="Papyrus">When 
                  she was young, Angie's family lived in such faraway locales 
                  as New Zealand and Saudi Arabia, but they have always considered 
                  home to be in Red Deer, Alberta.&nbsp; Angie was a quiet kid, 
                  happy to have her nose buried in a book and to hang out with 
                  her many pets.&nbsp; When she was 15, Angie moved to Victoria, 
                  BC to attend a private boarding school.&nbsp; It was her first 
                  time living away from home, but she loved the experience - the 
                  desire to move to distant places seems to run in the family.</font></p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font color="#400080" face="Papyrus">High 
                  school in BC led to university in Quebec as Angie moved to Montreal 
                  to attend McGill.&nbsp; At first she tried to pursue her high 
                  school interest in biochemistry and physiology, but halfway 
                  through her degree she changed courses and graduated with a 
                  BA in Religious Studies. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#400080" face="Papyrus">After 
          graduating from McGill, Angie moved directly to Fukue, Japan to teach 
          English to Japanese junior high school students. The town she lived 
          in was very remote and very rural, but the complete immersion in the 
          culture and language was an enlightening, rather than frightening, experience. 
          &nbsp; Angie learned Japanese, made friends, and studied Japanese dance 
          and flower arranging (ikebana). While in Japan, Angie took the opportunity 
          to travel often in SouthEast Asia and the Pacific, as her 'gypsy feet' 
          led her to ever more distant and exotic locales.&nbsp; Even after leaving 
          Japan almost four years ago, she still has an interest and special fondness 
          for all things Japanese - especially Johnny!</font></p>
<p><font color="#400080" face="Papyrus">After 
          two years in Japan, the time came for Angie to return to Canada.&nbsp; 
          She chose to move to Vancouver in order to stay close to the Japanese 
          community, and hopefully keep up her Japanese language skills (this 
          hasn't happened).&nbsp; After months of struggling to find work and 
          friends in Vancouver, she finally started to make the city her home 
          (although she's still confused by all the one-way streets downtown).</font></p>
                <p><font color="#400080" face="Papyrus">Johnny 
          and Angie were introduced by a mutual friend, and Angie noticed that 
          he was quite a catch right away; they became a couple in the autumn 
          of 2001.&nbsp; Falling in love was an easy next step, and Johnny's flexibility 
          and diverse interests continue to compliment Angie's wanderlust and 
          frequently-distracted curiosity well.&nbsp; She hopes their life together 
          will involve travel, kids, and lots of pets, maybe all at the same time!</font></p>
