<font face="Times New Roman,Times">M<font size=+1>ay, 1996:</font></font>
<br><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman,Times">On his spring break from 
university, Jun borrowed my car and with his friend drove to LA, where the car 
developed an engine problem and was towed to a dealer.&nbsp; When he called me a 
long distance from the outskirt of the big city, I got an impression he was 
going to wait till the work would be done.&nbsp; But judging from my automobile 
industry experience, I knew the scale of engine overhaul would take much longer 
than told by the staff at the shop.&nbsp; I told him to keep the car in dealer's 
care and fly back.&nbsp; By then his friend had left home already.&nbsp; Luckly 
he found a very economical flight from LA to Seattle.&nbsp; I drove there and 
picked him up.</font></p>
<p><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman,Times">Initially I 
was planning to fly to LA and drove the car back once the work was completed in 
a week or so.&nbsp; Then days went by, I realized riding from Canada to LA was 
one of my dream trips for many years.&nbsp; One logestic problem had been one 
way bike transportation, because I didn't want to ride both ways.&nbsp; Now it was
a golden opportunity to ride a bike from Burnaby, BC to fetch the car.&nbsp; The 
return transportation would be waiting for me at the destination.&nbsp; I talked 
to the service manager I would be  there in a month.</font></p>
<p><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman,Times">It was my longest
continuous camping of 30 days and 3,000 km.&nbsp; I moved everyday, thanks
to the consistent weather, and never camped at the same location.<br>
First I headed to Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal to get to Victoria.&nbsp; I can 
remember 10 km out of home, over Alex Fraser Bridge to cross the mighty Fraser, 
the enormous distance ahead of me.&nbsp; I spent the first night at MacDonald 
Park, a few km's south of Swarlz Bay.&nbsp; Early in the next morning from 
downtown Victoria, I caught a ferry to Port Angeles, Washington State, the other 
side of Juan Fuca Strait.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" size="+1">By then, I had a route in my 
mind.&nbsp; That was I would stick to the coast as much as possible.&nbsp; So, 
to the west side of Olympic Peninsula.&nbsp; On the third day, I was planning to 
take a detour into Ho Rain Forest Park.&nbsp; The closure sign greeted me at the 
entrance.&nbsp; May was too early.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" size="+1">After several days of wilderness 
campings, I hit a first town along the Columbia river and had craving for Kentucky Fried chickens.&nbsp; 
Now, I know why.&nbsp; I was shedding my body fat by strenous exercises.&nbsp; I 
went in the first sight of the sign and ordered four pieces which quenched my 
hunger for greasy food.&nbsp; That was the last fried chicken for the whole 
year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" size="+1">The bridge spanning the Columbia 
was impressive with its arch, particularly so, from a cyclist's point of view 
thinking of the height I have to gain by pure muscles.<br>
On the other side of the bridge, I was in the State of Oregon; a sense of 
accomplishment was felt within my heart.&nbsp; My expectation of good cycling on 
the Oregon coast swell, too.<br>
Eye catching secenery was those seastacks, jotting out of the sea with all sorts 
of shapes and size.&nbsp; I past through rather famous tourist beaches like 
Cannon Ball beaches without stopping.&nbsp; I stopped at a renowned youth hostel 
at Seaside.&nbsp; When I was there, the day was young and after chatting with 
proprietors I took the road.</font></p>
