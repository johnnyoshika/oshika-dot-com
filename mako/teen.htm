              <td width="490" valign="top"> 
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Mako's teenage 
                  years started where his childhood left off; still going strong 
                  with hockey and skiing. Hockey tournaments sent him all over 
                  British Columbia, while our family's Christmas vacation in Whistler 
                  became a ritual.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">His temper 
                  still fueled some fights at school (Burnaby South Secondary), 
                  which was fine when it was against other students, but when 
                  they involved his teachers, he got suspended. If I remember 
                  correctly, he got suspended a couple of times because of...er...heated 
                  arguments with teachers..</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I don't 
                  know exactly how many times he got into fights at school, but 
                  I did hear of this one incident when some little shrimp challenged 
                  him. Regretfully so I'm sure, as he soon found himself in Mako's 
                  patented headlock (I like to think that I taught him that) and 
                  in tears.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">So, he had 
                  inappropriate encounters with peers, teachers, and...who else 
                  is left? Ah, parents of course... During P.E., a fellow student 
                  grabbed Mako's (actually mine that he borrowed) shirt, yanked 
                  it, and ripped it. Because he treasured what belonged to me 
                  so much, he threatened to kick the #&amp;*$ out of the kid if 
                  he didn't bring $30 to school the next day. When he didn't, 
                  Mako went to the kid's home, got into a shouting match with 
                  his mother and came home empty handed. That night, a knock on 
                  the door revealed that the kid's father wanted to fight Mako. 
                  Because fathers are so tough, he brought a bat with him and 
                  told my mother to get her *&amp;$#&amp;ing kid outside now so 
                  that he can kick the *&amp;#$* out of him. Very good parental 
                  example indeed. Mako answered his challenge but Mom wouldn't 
                  let him out of the house. The father didn't get what he wanted 
                  so he went home and called the police. Yes you heard me right. 
                  After threatening to beat up my brother, this guy who was twice 
                  my brother's age, goes home and calls the cops. That night, 
                  we had two visits from the cops. The first was to warn Mako 
                  that if he touched the kid at school, he'll be in big trouble. 
                  Mako calmly told them that he will gladly pay the consequences 
                  that come with beating someone. This lead to the cops' second 
                  visit. To deliver $30 from the kid's father.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Need for 
                  speed? Mako had it. Especially when he was a new driver. At 
                  first, he only had access to Mom's Hyundai Pony. Now, it doesn't 
                  matter if you're Jacque Villeneuve, you can't pick-up speed 
                  in that thing. But his time came when Dad bought a Hyundai Elantra. 
                  Not exactly a speed demon, but enough horses to get your heart 
                  pumping if Mako's your driver. The first day he took it out, 
                  he filled the car with his friends and took it to 170 km/h. 
                  Not exactly record breaking territory, but certainly could have 
                  caused problems in that school zone. I still remember the smile 
                  on his face when he told me what he did.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">His final 
                  years of high-school were highlighted with time spent with his 
                  then-girlfriend, Rita. They seemed to do everything together, 
                  which faired well with me, as Rita worked at Sport-Chek and 
                  always gave me a generous discount.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Yes, my 
                  brother got into trouble on the rare occasion. And he felt that 
                  he was invincible. But one thing that you couldn't ignore about 
                  Mako was his ability to pull-off first class grades in school 
                  without doing what teachers preach most: studying. While I was 
                  in the dumpsters trying to pass every year, Mako's grades were 
                  flourishing. The only stumbling-block he hit with academics 
                  was when he knew a subject better than his teacher. Japanese 
                  (a language that Mako was fluent in) class is the perfect example. 
                  I'm sure he let his teacher know that he/she shouldn't be teaching 
                  a course with such limited knowledge of the subject. The final 
                  laugh goes to the teacher though, as Mako was awarded with a 
                  failing grade. But rare occasions aside, I think at this stage 
                  Mako was starting to realize that he had a talent that so few 
                  people do. He knew that natural intelligence could take him 
                  a long way, and he later took full advantage of it.</font></p>
