                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> While my 
                  brother's memories are still fresh in my mind, I'd like to share 
                  with everyone the life of my brother through my eyes. I would 
                  like to stress that it is just that: through my eyes. What I 
                  am going to say is opinionated and subjective, and there will 
                  certainly be people will different views. But who would be better 
                  to tell Mako's story than his older brother?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">There is 
                  a natural tendency to paint a nice picture of someone that passes 
                  away. This is not my intention here. I would like to tell his 
                  story as I perceive it. My brother was a very complex person 
                  with many flaws. But he was also very gifted in many ways. I 
                  hope I will be able to describe Mako in an accurate fashion.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">People often 
                  ask if I was close to my brother. While he was alive, I would 
                  have probably said &quot;no&quot;. We didn't share secrets and 
                  we didn't talk about girls. But no matter how you look at it, 
                  we were brothers. This one time in Europe, I looked at myself 
                  and what I was wearing. A yellow &quot;Helly Hanson&quot; rain 
                  jacket that Mako bought for me for no apparent reason, runners 
                  that Mako bought for my 22nd birthday, and his Khaki pants that 
                  he gave me because they were too small for him. On that very 
                  day, I'm sure Mako spent some time on the computer that I had 
                  bought him, spent some money somewhere which could have very 
                  well been part of the cheque I sent him for Christmas, and rode 
                  on the mountain bike that was passed down to him. While these 
                  are simply purchased products, it demonstrates our willingness 
                  to support each other. And I can't think of anyone who spent 
                  more time with him than myself.</font></p>
