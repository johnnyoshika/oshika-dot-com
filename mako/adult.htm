              <td width="490" valign="top"> 
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Mako got 
                  accepted to the University of British Columbia in Engineering. 
                  Following in the footsteps of his older brother? Whatever his 
                  motive, it didn't take long for him to realize he didn't like 
                  it. I don't know what exactly he didn't like about it. According 
                  to Mom (I wasn't living at home then) he did absolutely no homework. 
                  This had Mom worried greatly. She asked me to talk to Mako and 
                  try and help him. Every time we did talk though, he would just 
                  laugh at how he just aced his last mid-term without studying 
                  at all, and that he couldn't understand why everyone else were 
                  having problems with such easy topics. Not quite having Mako's 
                  natural intelligence, I cringed at how half-heartedly he went 
                  about school and pulled off the grades that he did. When all 
                  the smoke cleared, he passed first year Engineering with flying 
                  colours and got accepted into Electrical Engineering.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Before his 
                  second year at UBC, he spent the summer in Japan working at 
                  a resort. This is where he began to do things impulsively. He 
                  suddenly quit without notice and returned home to Vancouver.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">His impulsive 
                  acts continued at school the next year. He quit school impulsively. 
                  He simply decided to not go to his exams, even though he was 
                  averaging near 80% at the time. So he went to work and live 
                  in Whistler, wanting to become a ski expert. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">His impulsive 
                  actions (as well as his girlfriend Erika's) gave their lives 
                  some excitement. While they both lived in Whistler, they impulsively 
                  decided to go to Mexico together, among other places.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Back to 
                  Mako and Whistler. He was fascinated with mogul skiing. But 
                  then he realized how boring skiing can get when you have a season's 
                  pass and not many people that would tag along. And I don't think 
                  he was enjoying work too much either. Retail is probably not 
                  in his blood. One of his co-workers told him that if his work 
                  is worth complaining about, then he should quit. He took her 
                  advice and walked out the door. Again, an impulsive move.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">He was one 
                  that liked to spend a lot of money. The only thing that held 
                  him back at times was his lack of it. But he really liked to 
                  spend on others. I can't tell you how many times he bought me 
                  things for no apparent reason. And when he bought stuff, it 
                  was the best of its kind. He didn't bother with second best. 
                  And there's a lot to be said about that. His belongings always 
                  seemed to last longer than mine (both in wear and style).</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Back at 
                  home, we started to see many traces of his no-fear attitude. 
                  If a car cut him off on the street, he would catch up to it 
                  by the next red light and pound the *^*^&amp; out of it. What 
                  if it was a semi? Not scary enough for Mako. He grabbed on to 
                  one while it was moving and attempted to get inside the driver's 
                  cabin. The best time for him to do such stunts was when he was 
                  on his bike and not driving. He got away with a lot more when 
                  on his bike, as his identity could not be traced by anything. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">He rode 
                  a bike to school a lot of the time. He developed a hobby of 
                  breaking cars side view mirrors if they came too close. (I don't 
                  think this is bad. I have wanted to do this many times. And 
                  I think we(cyclists) need someone like Mako to get the message 
                  across.) After a while, he was able to accumulate a list of 
                  cars that had strong side view mirrors and ones that didn't. 
                  Take note everyone, BMW mirrors are super wimpy and Mako can 
                  break one off with a single whack. On the other hand, Acuras 
                  always took him a few whacks.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The best 
                  Mako story on his bike is when a Honda Civic cut him off. He 
                  caught up to him at the next red light and started to jump on 
                  his hood. When the driver got out to try and get a hold of Mako, 
                  Mako ran around the car into the driver seat and started driving 
                  off with it. No fear. No fear.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Well, shortly 
                  after his Whistler days ended, he decided to go back to school. 
                  This time in Computer Science, back at UBC. After a couple of 
                  years, he started to find it a little easy and boring. But he 
                  dedicated himself to complete his degree. He went about his 
                  normal ways of not studying too much and getting top notch grades.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I think 
                  he felt that a Computer Science degree was a little limiting 
                  for him. So he stated several times that he wanted to go into 
                  Electrical Engineering after completing Computers. The last 
                  time he said this was days before his death.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Mako and 
                  I started investing a little together. We both started learning 
                  a bit about the stock market, while playing with a small sum 
                  of money. The last time I heard from him was when I was in Europe. 
                  He sent me an email and told me that he really wanted to buy 
                  Redhat, and that they were about to go public. I gave him the 
                  green light to do whatever he wanted with our money. He didn't 
                  live long enough to invest in Redhat. He didn't even live long 
                  enough to see Redhat skyrocket 500% on its first day of trading, 
                  and up 1500% 5 months later.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Mako won't 
                  even get to witness the Y2K bug saga fold out. With his knowledge 
                  in computers and his interest in technology in general, I'm 
                  sure he was excited about the whole thing.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">On July 
                  19th, 1999, Mako killed himself. To this day, no one is certain 
                  why. I believe it was an impulsive move. The night before his 
                  death, out of anger, he said that he would kill himself. Mako 
                  was always one to do whatever he said. This was no exception.</font></p>
