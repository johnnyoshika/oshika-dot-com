Sep. 14-18: Sizzle trip(Hotsprings trip from Pemberton to Harrison
and then back home.*
<br>&nbsp;
<p>*This will be postponed by one week. But I really did it.
<p>The first day, I rode BC Rail from North Van. to Pemberton. I could
have ridden to Mt. Curie, but the price would have jumped by several dollars
and stopped at Pemberton. On the way, I popped in the airport and had a
glider ride.
<p>The slight slope next to Lizzie Bay forced me to call it a day and camped
there at forest campsite. It was one of the best sites of the whole trip.
Surprisingly I was all alone.
<p>The second day, I stopped at Skoocum Hotsrprings for a rest. This time
I was afraid of being fatigued after a bath and did not soak. I pushed
up to the North fork of Slouquet Cr., where I camped; a squiel was the
only companion that evening.
<p>The third day, in the morning I crossed the creek by a fallen tree and
hiked to the Slouquet Hotsprings. The distance was much longer than expected
and took me almost one hour. Here I did not miss a soak. I saw a lone tent
up on the longing road but noone in the pools down below.
<p>As anticipated the section south of Tipella was the roughest and I walked
quite a distance. When I saw the sign of Wood Lake forest campsite, I felt
relieved. The site was full of people and very noisy; particulary a couple
using a chain saw cutting their fire wood. Fortunately I was so tired that
I did not have much problem to sleep.
<p>Finally on the fourth day, I could have a brunch at the Indian Reserve
cafe before Sasquach Inn. Once I hit the Lougheed Highway my progress improved
dramatically and easily reached my home in the early afternoon.
