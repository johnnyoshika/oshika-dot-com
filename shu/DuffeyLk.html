<p>Duffey Lake area has a rather heavy traffic these days, so I heard. And it's 
  very much justifiable. Serise Creek Cabin was built sometime ago, and now Wendy 
  Thompson Hut is placed in Marriott Basin, opposite from Serise. When I first 
  visited this area on skis, there was no cabin. We camped in the trees, below 
  now-a-day Serise cabin. I think it was an Alpine Club trip. There are two things 
  I remember well. One was a bonfire the leader made right on the snow, which 
  brightened our sprits so much. Another was one of the members with whom I climbed 
  Vantage Peak on the day we arrived. Enrico was a Varsity Outdoors Club member 
  at UBC. Several years later I learnt he died on Mt. Robson on his winter climb. 
  For a while I borrowed and kept the Freedom of Hills with his signature from 
  library of VOC. Ray and I camped only minutes away from Duffey Lake Road. The 
  next day I skied to Wendy Thompson Hut with a day pack. Both of us wanted to 
  see the location of the hut for our future trip. It wasn't our first time into 
  the Cayoosh valley. We had skied up to the lake towards Rohr Peak. A year later 
  again two of us tried to gain the Rohr's south west ridge directly from the 
  road. This time I had difficulty finding the entrance to Rohr route. We proceeded 
  to the basin where the new hut was. Just as I imagined it was past the first 
  lake in the basin. There were three teachers from Vancouver; apparently it was 
  in the middle of spring break. One of them had visited Hokkaido and hiked there. 
  Ray shared his story, because he was also in Hokkaido recently. The cabin was 
  rather Spartan without a stove, but it sure attracts outdoor people into the 
  area. (Note: April 4, 2002) </p>
