                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A year and 
                  a half had passed by since my birth and I was getting bored. 
                  The legos, toys, and dolls were simply not doing it anymore. 
                  I needed someone to play with me; but most of all, I needed 
                  someone to beat-up. Little did I know, I would get both my wishes 
                  on December 2nd 1977, when my brother Makoto was born.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Like all 
                  other new borns, Mako came into this world with no knowledge 
                  of, well, anything. It was my duty to take full advantage of 
                  this. From the beginning, I set the record straight. Whatever 
                  was new, I got to have. As soon as I outgrew them, they were 
                  Mako's. But the best example must have been when we were given 
                  Grandma's old piggy bank. We were to split it 50/50. That day, 
                  I was in a very generous mood (after all, as the older brother, 
                  it was my duty to do things in the best interest of Mako). I 
                  told him that if he promised to behave well and not tell our 
                  parents, I'd let him take a nickel (bigger coins=more value), 
                  for every dime that I took. From that day on, Mako was confident 
                  that I would be a good big brother.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I taught 
                  Mako how to fight. The only problem for him was that I used 
                  his body for demonstration purposes. Anyone who spent time with 
                  us when we were young would tell you that when we got mad at 
                  each other, sparks flew. Through the pounding, kicking, and 
                  drawing blood, it's hard to believe that neither of us lost 
                  an eye, or head for that matter.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Mako can 
                  (and with good reason) be criticized for being a difficult kid. 
                  He sometimes acted for the sole purpose of making things difficult. 
                  During one of our many trips to Japan, our aunt took us to an 
                  amusement park. Sitting there was a candy dispenser. He pointed 
                  to it, and told (not asked) Auntie to buy it. Having a hard 
                  time turning down a cute little face, our aunt bought a candy 
                  for Mako. Mako then shook his head. He pointed to the candy 
                  dispenser. Not to a single candy, but the whole thing. Traits 
                  like this were observed all the time.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Mako's childhood 
                  was full of outdoor adventures. He benefited from his father's 
                  love of challenging Mother Nature. By the time I was old enough 
                  to realize that sitting at home in the warmth of the living 
                  room is a lot more fun than hiking for miles and miles in the 
                  deadly rain, Mako still followed Dad around like a blind sheep. 
                  But that didn't last long. Like any kid, Mako started growing 
                  up. And that spelled the end of the &quot;following Dad around&quot; 
                  era.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">His mother 
                  was a sport advocate. He learned to first ski when he was only 
                  2 years old. For most kids, walking is a difficult feat. Skiing 
                  was a lifelong hobby of Mako's, but it didn't end there. He 
                  participated in team activities which began with soccer as a 
                  young child and later in pursuit of the Canadian dream, hockey. 
                  Was he really athletic? Well, he was more of a fierce competitor. 
                  I still remember when he got nailed from behind in hockey. The 
                  culprit, who must have had an extra 4 inches and 50 pounds on 
                  Mako, must have been shocked to see Mako get up so fast, knock 
                  him down, and pound him.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">That fierceness 
                  in him soon became a trait of his. While it was good during 
                  hockey, it presented problems in school. Before the age of 11, 
                  he was kicked out of both Gladstone Japanese School and Sir 
                  James Douglas Elementary School, the latter forcing him to give 
                  up French immersion.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His childhood years 
                  were just beginning to show signs of the type of person Mako 
                  would become. He would stand up for himself no matter what the 
                  situation. He did what was in his best interest and didn't care 
                  what other people thought of him. And his newly developed temper 
                  was vicious enough to scare even the toughest of mankind. Also, 
                  he began to realize that he had natural intelligence that other 
                  kids can only dream of. All these traits would become more apparent 
                  as he entered his teenage years.</font></p>
