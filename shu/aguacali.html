<p>Agua caliente: </p>
<p>When we camped at Playa Coyote, Peter, our guide told us that natural
hotsprings could be found one hour paddle away from where we were. As a
hotspring enthusiast it could not be missed.
<p>As (was) always, Peter sensed my desire and offered an opportunity.
Everyone-else opted for cycling and so, it would be my solo paddle in a
foreign country. Though I had some experience of kayaking on the waters
of BC coast, the turquoise waters of Bahia Concepcion looked inhabit the
Siren of Ulysses or the Lorelei of the Rhine. I feared the kayak might
be swallowed into the depth.
<p>Once launched, my favourite Arluk responded to my paddle strokes and
cut the mirror blue water into wakes. The sound of water droplets surrounded
me.
<p>Fourty five minutes passed; I was progressing faster than normal, being
urged by uneasiness of alien environments.
<p>A few islands and a small beach, exactly like the description Peter
had explained appeared ahead. I landed and walked from end to end without
any sign of hot water. Instead I saw two local fishermen having a nap in
a makeshift shack at the far end. With tourist rudeness I woke them up
and asked about the hotsprings, managing my crude Spanish.
<p>The Old one grabbed a shovel and walked to the other end of the beach
and dug. Then hot water poured out flowing into the bay. I thanked him
and gathered rocks to build a pool for a bath.
<p>Lying in the shallow warm water, under the sun baked secenery, the dust
I had accumulated during the past week of cycling (being) washed away,
all of the anxieties I had been experiencing vanished and finally felt
a deep inner happiness.(11:29 04/11/99)
